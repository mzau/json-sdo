This project specifies a method to communicate by a JSON based protocol with CANopen or EtherCAT fieldbus devices. The software coming along demonstrates a Javascript based client and a Java servlet which represents a simulated DS 301 device.


### Main features ###

  * field bus device can carry its own commissioning tool with itself. Only an internet browser is required to "run" the tool.
  * simple programming in Javascript
  * low firmware overhead suited for 8 or 16 bit architectures
